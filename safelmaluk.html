        <p id="saad"><b>Saiful Muluk</b> (Urdu: جھیل سیف الملوک) is a mountainous lake in northern Pakistan, located at
            the northern end of the <span style="color: blue;">Kaghan</span> Valley, near the town of Naran in the
            Saiful Muluk National Park. At an elevation of 3,224 m
            (10,578 feet) above sea level, the lake is located above the tree line, and is one of the highest lakes in
            <span style="color: blue;">Pakistan</span>.
        </p>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Saiful Muluk is located in the Mansehra district of <span style="color: blue;">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</span>,
            about 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) north of
            Naran,[2][3] in the northern part of Kaghan.<span style="color: blue;"> Malika Parbat</span>, the highest
            peak in the valley is near
            the lake.[4]</p>
        <p>The lake is accessible from the nearby town of Naran during the summer season but access during winter is
            limited, as heavy <span style="color: blue;">snowfall</span> and landslides threaten to cutoff the lake from
            other regions.</p>
        <h2>Physical features</h2>
        <hr>
        <p id="us">Saiful Muluk was formed by <span style="color: blue;">glacial moraines</span> that blocked the water of the stream passing through the
            valley.[5] The <span style="color: blue;">Kaghan Valley</span> was formed in the greater<span style="color: blue;"> Pleistocene Period</span> dating back almost 300,000 years
            when the area was covered with ice. Rising temperatures and receding glaciers left a large depression where
            glaciers once stood. Melting water collected into the lake</p>
